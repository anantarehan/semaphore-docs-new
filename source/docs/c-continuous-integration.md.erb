This document contains information related to projects based on Ubuntu 14.04 image. 
If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 image for your projects please refer to [this page](https://semaphoreci.com/docs/ubuntu-1804.html). 

If you are using Ubuntu 14.04 image and you want to switch to Ubuntu 18.04 be sure to check our [migration guide](https://semaphoreci.com/docs/ubuntu-1804.html#how-to-use-new-platform).

You can test and integrate C/C++ programs on Semaphore using the preinstalled
build tools such as gcc, g++ and Make. You can also leverage
[caching between builds](/docs/caching-between-builds.html) by copying relevant
assets to the `.semaphore-cache` directory.

The Semaphore stack includes the following GCC/G++ versions:

<% package_versions("gcc").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

To switch between the available GCC/G++ versions, use the `change-gcc-version <version>` command (eg.
`change-gcc-version 4.9`).

The list of all supported packages and versions is available on the
[supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.
