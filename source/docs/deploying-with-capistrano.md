[Capistrano](http://www.capistranorb.com) is a widely used server automation and
deployment tool written in Ruby and various other programming languages.
Semaphore lets you easily use your existing Capistrano scripts to set up
automatic deployment.

To get started, go to your project's settings and under "Deployment" tab follow
the link to add a new server.

This will launch a simple 5 step process.

## Choosing your deployment method

The first step is to select Capistrano as your deployment method.

## Choosing your deployment strategy

<img src="/docs/assets/img/deploying-with-capistrano/deployment-strategy.png" alt="Deployment Strategy" class="img-responsive img-bordered">

There are two deployment strategies on Semaphore: "automatic" and "manual".

**Automatic** means that a deploy will be triggered after every passed build on
the selected branch. Besides that, you can also manually deploy any build from
any branch at any time.

**Manual** strategy requires manual selection of builds to deploy.

For automatic deployment you will be asked to select which branch will be
automatically deployed after each passed build.

**Note**: You can easily change the deployment strategy from server settings at
any time after the setup is complete.

## Writing deploy commands

Writing custom deploy commands gives you an ability to use the deploy steps that
match your server setup. During a deploy, Semaphore sets the `REVISION` [environment
variable](/docs/available-environment-variables.html) which contains the current Git revision being deployed.

**Note**: Capistrano truncates server responses that are longer than the terminal. Full display can be achieved by adding to your `deploy.rb` the following:
```
set :format_options, truncate: false
```

## Adding a private SSH key for deploy

At this point you need to provide a private SSH key which Semaphore will use to
deploy your code.

We recommend that you create separate SSH keys specifically for Semaphore
deployment.

Generate new, passwordless key pair with `ssh-keygen -t rsa` command and then
add the newly created private key to Semaphore.

The public key should be added to your server, to the `.ssh/authorized_keys`
file, inside the userâ€™s home directory which is used for deploying.

Through these steps you give Semaphore permission to access your server through
your Capistrano script and successfully execute deploy commands.

**Note:** The private key will be encrypted on Semaphore and will be available
only during the deployment process. After the initial setup there is no way to
change it through Semaphore interface. You can identify it with the fingerprint
on the project settings page.

If you are using SSH agent forwarding with Capistrano, you will need to make sure
that the SSH key which is used on Semaphore is added as a deploy key to the
GitHub repository as well.

## Naming your server on Semaphore

<img src="/docs/assets/img/deploying-with-capistrano/server-name.png" alt="Server Name" class="img-responsive img-bordered">

In this step you need to provide a name for your server, which can be any name
you like. It will be used on your Semaphore dashboard and deployment timeline.
During this step, you may also choose to set a server URL for quick access to
wherever you are deploying your application.

Each server has its own _alias_ which represents server's name in a safe string
form. The alias is also available in the deploy environment via
`SEMAPHORE_SERVER_NAME` environment variable.

By now the setup is complete - you are ready to automatically deploy to your
server.
