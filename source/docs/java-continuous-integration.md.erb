Semaphore supports the following Java versions:

<% package_versions("java").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

Switching between Java versions is done by adding the following command to your
build commands:

`change-java-version <version>`

Valid values for `<version>` are `1.7` or `7` for OpenJDK 7 and `1.8` or `8` for Oracle
JDK 8. The default Java version is `openjdk-7`.

To use `change-java-version` in a bash script, use the following command to load
it:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

source /opt/change-java-version.sh
```

The Semaphore stack includes:

- <%= package_name("gradle") %> (<%= package_version("gradle") %>)

- <%= package_name("maven") %> (<%= package_version("maven") %>)

- [<%= package_name("scala") %>](/docs/scala-continuous-integration.html) (<%= package_versions("scala").join(", ") %>)

List of all packages and versions is available on the
[supported application stack](/docs/supported-stack.html) page.
