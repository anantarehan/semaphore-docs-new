title: How to add new branches automatically?
category: Build troubleshooting

If you want to make sure your branches on GitHub repository and ones on
Semaphore Classic project are in sync, new branches will need to be added
automatically and the existing ones will need to be added manually. Specific
naming of branches does not affect the automatic adding of the branches,
however some form of the naming convention might be useful if there are any
[high priority branches](https://semaphoreci.com/docs/set-high-priority-branches.html), or if you wish to [turn off automatic testing](https://semaphoreci.com/docs/turn-off-automatic-testing-of-new-branches.html) for some of the
new branches.
