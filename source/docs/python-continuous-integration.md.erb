This document contains information related to projects based on Ubuntu 14.04 image. 
If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 image for your projects please refer to [this page](https://semaphoreci.com/docs/ubuntu-1804.html). 

If you are using Ubuntu 14.04 image and you want to switch to Ubuntu 18.04 be sure to check our upgrade guide](https://semaphoreci.com/docs/ubuntu-1804.html#how-to-use-new-platform).

Semaphore makes it easy to setup continuous integration for Python projects.
When you add a project from a Python repository, Semaphore will run a brief
analysis and suggest some common commands based on the structure of your repository.

For example, after the analysis determines that the project is written in Python
and it has a `requirements.txt` file, the following commands will be suggested:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py test
```

You can easily [change or add more build commands](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html),
customize your build environment with [configuration files](/docs/adding-configuration-files.html),
[environment variables](/docs/exporting-environment-variables.html) and more
(see the 'Customizing your build' section for more information).

## CI environment for Python projects

The [Semaphore platform](/docs/supported-stack.html) supports a wide range of
Python versions:

<% package_versions("python").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

Python environments are managed with `virtualenv` version <%= package_version("virtualenv") %>. Selecting a Python version in
`Project Settings` activates the corresponding Python environment in your build.
Virtual environments are created in the following path:
`/home/runner/.pyenv/<version>`.

Pre-installed packages include [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), [mock](https://pypi.org/project/mock/),
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/),
and [nose](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Change Python version with a command

If you have another language set in Project Settings, but you need a specific Python
version as well, you can use `change-python-version` in your setup:

```bash
Usage:
  change-python-version <version>

  Supported versions are: 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
```

## Dependency management

Python packages installed with `pip` are [cached between builds](/docs/caching-between-builds.html)
on Semaphore. By default, `pip` packages are downloaded to `/home/runner/.pip_download_cache`.
