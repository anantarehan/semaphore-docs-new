This document contains information related to projects based on the Ubuntu 14.04 image. 
If you are using the Ubuntu 18.04 image for your projects, please refer to [this page](https://semaphoreci.com/docs/ubuntu-1804.html). 

If you are using the Ubuntu 14.04 image and you want to switch to Ubuntu 18.04, be sure to check our [upgrade guide](https://semaphoreci.com/docs/ubuntu-1804.html#how-to-upgrade).

Semaphore makes it easy to set up continuous integration for Scala projects.
Both [Java](/docs/java-continuous-integration.html) and Scala runtimes are
preinstalled in the build environment. When you create a project with a Scala
repository, Semaphore will analyze it and suggest to run the tests with the
current Scala version and `sbt`.

After the analysis determines that the project is written in Scala, the
following command will be suggested.

```bash
sbt ++$SEMAPHORE_SCALA_VERSION test
```

You can easily [change or add more build
commands](/docs/customizing-build-commands.html), customize your build
environment with [configuration
files](/docs/adding-configuration-files.html), [environment
variables](/docs/exporting-environment-variables.html) and more (see the
'Customizing your build' section for more
information).

## CI environment for Scala projects

The [Semaphore platform](/docs/supported-stack.html) supports the following
Scala versions:

<% package_versions("scala").each do |version| %>
  - <%= version %>
<% end %>

Manually switching between Scala versions can be done with the
`change-scala-version <version>` command. Supported versions in the
utility are `2.11` and `2.12`. The current version of Scala is also avaliable
through the `SEMAPHORE_SCALA_VERSION` environment variable.

[sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) version <%= package_version("sbt") %> is
pre-installed.

## Dependency management

Cached resolution is available in `sbt` as an [experimental feature]
(https://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Cached-Resolution.html#Cached+resolution)
starting from version `0.13.7`. If you use this feature, the contents of
`~/.sbt/0.13/dependency/` is [cached between
builds](/docs/caching-between-builds.html) on Semaphore.

[Apache Ivy](https://github.com/apache/ant-ivy) dependencies are also cached, which
significantly reduces the build time.
