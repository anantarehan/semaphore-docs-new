<strong style="background: yellow;">⛔️ Warning ⛔️</strong>:
This guide is for Semaphore Classic, which has been superseded by
[Semaphore 2.0](https://semaphoreci.com). For information on how to install
the Semaphore 2.0 CLI, **[follow this
guide](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/63-your-first-project)** instead.

<hr/>

The Semaphore Command Line Interface (CLI), is a tool named `sem` that can be used for creating and managing
Semaphore projects from the command line / shell of various operating systems.
It is built with Ruby and the code is [open sourced](https://github.com/renderedtext/cli).

If you have any problems or feature requests please
[open an issue in the CLI repository on GitHub](https://github.com/renderedtext/cli/issues).

### Prerequisites and installation

The Semaphore CLI requires Ruby >= 2.0 to run on your system. Before
installation, verify that you have an up to date Ruby on your system.

``` bash

The Semaphore CLI is installed as a gem. Run the following command:

``` bash
$ gem install sem
```

Verify that the installation succeded:

``` bash

```

### Authentication

To manage resources on Semaphore, you need to log in to Semaphore from the
command line:

``` bash

To log out, execute the following:

The `help` command will always display an example use case of the command.

### Troubleshooting

The Semaphore CLI can display all the API requests that can help with identifying
issues. This mode is called _trace_ mode.

To run the CLI in trace mode, pass the `--trace` flag to the CLI:

``` bash
$ sem orgs:list --trace
