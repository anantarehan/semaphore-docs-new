Default timezone in the virtual machine is set to UTC and can be changed in 2 ways:

- You may assign a different value to **TZ** environment variable. For example:

```
export TZ=Europe/Belgrade
```

This would change the time zone from default UTC, to CET (Europe/Belgrade).

- Alternatively, the same result can be achieved by creating a symlink in /etc/localtime 
to one of the available timezones. Using the same timezone as in the previous example:

```
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Belgrade /etc/localtime
```
