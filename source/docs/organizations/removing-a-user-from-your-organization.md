If a user in your organization no longer requires access to any of the projects
they have been given access to, you can remove them from the organization.

##How to remove a user from an organization

Only users who are in the _Owners_ team can remove other users from an
organization. In order to remove a user from your organization, you need to:

1. Go to your **Account** in the main menu.

##How to remove a user who has created some projects in your organization

In order to remove the user who has created some projects, it is necessary to
replace user-project association first.
For security reasons, we are not able to do this on your behalf, and you can do
it by following the next steps:

1. Go to Project Settings page,
2. Choose Repository tab,
3. Click on the "Change repository" button in the bottom right corner.

This way, these projects will become associated with your GitHub/Bitbucket account.
These steps should be repeated for all projects created by the user you would
like to remove from the organization. This can be performed by any member of the
Owners team in your organization.

Also, in order to perform this action, the user has to have the same level of
permissions for the repository as for [adding a project to Semaphore](/docs/adding-github-bitbucket-project-to-semaphore.html).

Projects which are associated with the specific user can be listed as follows:

1. In the top right corner of any Semaphore's page, click on your profile photo,
then choose a relevant organization from the drop down menu.
2. On the left side of the organization's page click on Projects.
